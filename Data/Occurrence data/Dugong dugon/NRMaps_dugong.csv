The high relative abundance of many marine megafauna species, particularly coastal dolphins and turtles suggest that the Northern Territory has some of the most important populations in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. These data will inform future research priorities for Dugong, marine turtles and cetaceans and contribute towards improved management of these important species. The primary objective of this Dugong aerial survey was to improve current knowledge of Dugong abundance and distribution in Northern Territory coastal waters and compare this with historical survey efforts. Additional transects were added to the previous Dugong aerial survey of 2007 to allow for a more detailed assessment of the coastal waters to the east of Groote Eylandt. Sampling intensity was 8% of the survey area.","NT",,"(not listed)",,"1",0,1,"1","Native to the N.T.",

The high relative abundance of many marine megafauna species, particularly coastal dolphins and turtles suggest that the Northern Territory has some of the most important populations in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. These data will inform future research priorities for Dugong, marine turtles and cetaceans and contribute towards improved management of these important species. The primary objective of this Dugong aerial survey was to improve current knowledge of Dugong abundance and distribution in Northern Territory coastal waters and compare this with historical survey efforts. Additional transects were added to the previous Dugong aerial survey of 2007 to allow for a more detailed assessment of the coastal waters to the east of Groote Eylandt.
